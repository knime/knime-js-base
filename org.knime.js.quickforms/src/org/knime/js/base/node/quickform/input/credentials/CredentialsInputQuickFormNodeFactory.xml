        <option name="Save password in configuration (weakly encrypted)">
          Whether the password should be saved with the workflow. Note that, if saved, the password can be revealed
          with modest effort by looking at the encryption algorithm used in KNIME's (open) source code. If the password 
          is not saved (option not set) the user will be prompted for the password when the workflow is opened unless
          the node is already saved executed. In the latter case the password is not prompted assuming downstream 
          consumer nodes, e.g. a DB reader, are also executed and no longer need the credentials. In such cases 
          (resetting and) executing a downstream node will fail as the password is not part of the credentials object
          passed from this node into the workflow - a re-configuration of this node is required.
        </option>
        <option name="Use KNIME Server Login (when run on server)">
         If the node is executed as part of a job on the KNIME Server Web Portal the password is populated with the user
         credentials  the log-in user.
