			<p>
                Quick Form node that allows uploading a file and exposing 
                that uploaded file using a flow variable. The node view is available in the KNIME WebPortal.
            </p>
		</intro>
		<option name="Label">A descriptive label that will be shown in, for instance the WebPortal.</option>
		<option name="Description">Some lines of description that will be shown in the remote control
			form, for instance by means of a tooltip.</option>
        <option name="Hide in Dialog">
          If the setting should be hidden in a surrounding wrapped metanode dialog.
        </option>
		<option name="Variable Name">Variable identifier. By default two variables are created, one with the file path and one with the file URL.<br/>
			If the default file is defined by a URL only the URL variable will be created.</option>
		<option name="Parameter Name">Parameter identifier for external parameterization (e.g. batch execution).</option>
		<option name="Valid File Extensions">
          A list of file extensions that is used as filter in the 
          file browser (not only the one in the "Default File" option but also
          in a remote file browser), e.g. ".csv,.csv.gz" will filter for
          files ending with ".csv" or ".csv.gz". Leave empty to accept any file.
        </option>
        <option name="Default File">
          The file that will be used during design time, i.e. when no file
          is uploaded by means of the, e.g. KNIME WebPortal.<br/>
          It is possible to enter a URL here. This can be useful if a default file is to be addressed with 
          the knime:// protocol (e.g. knime://knime.workflow/../data/file.csv) or if the file is present on a remote server.
        </option>
        <option name="Timeout">
        The time in seconds after which the connection times out. The timeout is used when testing the existence of default files. The default is set to 1 second and should be sufficient in most cases.
        </option>
        <option name="Disable output, if file does not exist">
          If enabled, output port will be disabled, if the provided file does not exist or cannot be accessed.<br/>
          This option is helpful in the wizard (WebPortal) execution to keep this and subsequent nodes from failing during execution.

		<outPort index="0" name="Flow Variable Output">
          Variable output representing the file path as variable. In case an absolute file path is selected the node
